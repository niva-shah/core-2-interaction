I wanted to design a portfolio webpage that displays images in like a grid formate. I used the 'display: flex;' to help me arrange content flexibly in the .portfolioCardContent' and '.portfolioCardWrap containers', ensuring they look good on different screen sizes. Although 'display: grid;' isn't used, it could make organizing cards easier if needed. the use of 'position: relative;' helps position the portfolio content and card grid inside their containers neatly, keeping everything in order as you scroll.
