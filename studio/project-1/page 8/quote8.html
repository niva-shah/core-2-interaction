        the sound of the rain
        hitting the driver’s top hat, the rain
        shining like satin on the black street,
        on the tips of patent leather shoes, Hokusai’s
        father who polished mirrors for a living, Hokusai’s
        father watching the sky for clouds, Hokusai’s father’s son
        drawing rain over a bridge and over the people crossing
        the bridge, Hokusai’s father’s son drawing the rain
        for hours, Hokusai’s father rubbing a mirror, the rain
        cold as the sea, the sea cold as love, the sea swelling
        to a tidal <a href="../page 2/quote2.html">wave</a>, at the tip of the wave white.

          Rain Effect</pre>
        <pre>
          A bride and a groom sitting in an open buggy
          in the rain, holding hands but not looking
          at each other, waiting for the rain to stop,
          waiting for the marriage to begin, embarrassed
          by the rain, the effect of the rain on the bridal
          veil, the wet horse with his mane in his eyes,
          the rain cold as the sea, the sea deep as love,
          big drops of rain falling on the leather seat,
          the rain beaded on a rose pinned to the groom’s
          lapel, the rain on the bride’s bouquet,
          on the baby’s breath there,
