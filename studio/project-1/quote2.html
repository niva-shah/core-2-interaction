This quiet roof, where dove-sails saunter by,
Between the pines, the tombs, throbs visibly.
Impartial noon patterns the sea in flame --
That sea forever starting and re-starting.
When thought has had its hour, oh how rewarding
Are the long vistas of celestial calm!
What grace of light, what pure toil goes to form
The manifold diamond of the elusive foam!
What peace I feel begotten at that source!
When sunlight rests upon a profound sea,
Time's air is sparkling, dream is certain --
Pure artifice both of an eternal Cause.

Sure treasure, simple shrine to intelligence,
Palpable calm, visible reticence,
Proud-lidded water, Eye wherein there wells
Under a film of fire such depth of sleep --
O silence! . . . Mansion in my soul, you slope
Of gold, roof of a myriad golden tiles.

Temple of time, within a brief sigh bound,
To this rare height inured I climb, surrounded
By the horizons of a sea-girt eye.
And, like my supreme offering to the gods,
That peaceful coruscation only breeds
A loftier indifference on the sky.

Even as a fruit's absorbed in the enjoying,
Even as within the mouth its body dying
Changes into delight through dissolution,
So to my melted soul the heavens declare
All bounds transfigured into a boundless air,
And I breathe now my future's emanation.

Beautiful heaven, true heaven, look how I change!
After such arrogance, after so much strange
Idleness -- strange, yet full of potency --
I am all open to these shining spaces;
Over the homes of the dead my shadow passes,
Ghosting along -- a ghost subduing me.
My soul laid bare to your midsummer fire,
O just, impartial light whom I admire,

Whose arms are merciless, you have I stayed
And give back, pure, to your original place.
Look at yourself. . . But to give light implies
No less a somber moiety of shade.

Oh, for myself alone, mine, deep within
At the heart's quick, the poem's fount, between
The void and its pure issue, I beseech
The intimations of my secret power.
O bitter, dark, and echoing reservoir
Speaking of depths always beyond my reach.

But know you -- feigning prisoner of the boughs,
Gulf which cats up their slender prison-bars,
Secret which dazzles though mine eyes are closed --
What body drags me to its lingering end,
What mind draws it to this bone-peopled ground ?
A star broods there on all that I have lost.

Closed, hallowed, full of insubstantial fire,
Morsel of earth to heaven's light given o'er --
This plot, ruled by its flambeaux, please me --
A place all gold, stone, and dark wood, where shudders
So much marble above so many shadows:
And on my tombs, asleep, the faithful sea.

Keep off the idolaters, bright watch-dog, while --
A solitary with the shepherd's smile --
I pasture long my sheep, my mysteries,
My snow-white flock of undisturbed graves!
Drive far away from here the careful doves,
The vain daydreams, the angels' questioning eyes!

Now present here, the future takes its time.
The brittle insect scrapes at the dry loam;
All is burned up, used up, drawn up in air
To some ineffably rarefied solution. . .
Life is enlarged, drunk with annihilation,
And bitterness is sweet, and the spirit clear.

The dead lie easy, hidden in earth where they
Are warmed and have their mysteries burnt away.
Motionless noon, noon aloft in the blue
Broods on itself -- a self-sufficient theme.
O rounded dome and perfect diadem,


I am what's changing secretly in you.

I am the only medium for your fears.
My penitence, my doubts, my baulked desires --
These are the flaw within your diamond pride. . .
But in their heavy night, cumbered with marble,
Under the roots of trees a shadow people
Has slowly now come over to your side.
To an impervious nothingness they're thinned,
For the red clay has swallowed the white kind;
Into the flowers that gift of life has passed.
Where are the dead? -- their homely turns of speech,
The personal grace, the soul informing each?
Grubs thread their way where tears were once composed.

The bird-sharp cries of girls whom love is teasing,
The eyes, the teeth, the eyelids moistly closing,
The pretty breast that gambles with the flame,
The crimson blood shining when lips are yielded,
The last gift, and the fingers that would shield it --
All go to earth, go back into the game.

And you, great soul, is there yet hope in you
To find some dream without the lying hue
That gold or wave offers to fleshly eyes?
Will you be singing still when you're thin air?
All perishes. A thing of flesh and pore
Am I. Divine impatience also dies.

Lean immortality, all crepe and gold,
Laurelled consoler frightening to behold,
Death is a womb, a mother's breast, you feign
The fine illusion, oh the pious trick!
Who does not know them, and is not made sick
That empty skull, that everlasting grin?

Ancestors deep down there, 0 derelict heads
Whom such a weight of spaded earth o'erspreads,
Who are the earth, in whom our steps are lost,
The real flesh-eater, worm unanswerable
Is not for you that sleep under the table:
Life is his meat, and I am still his host.

'Love,' shall we call him? 'Hatred of self,' maybe?
His secret tooth is so intimate with me
That any name would suit him well enough,
Enough that he can see, will, daydream, touch --
My flesh delights him, even upon my couch
I live but as a morsel of his life.

Zeno, Zeno, cruel philosopher Zeno,
Have you then pierced me with your feathered arrow
That hums and flies, yet does not fly! The sounding
Shaft gives me life, the arrow kills. Oh, sunshine! --
Oh, what a tortoise-shadow to outrun
My soul, Achilles' giant stride left standing!

No, no! Arise! The future years unfold.
Shatter, O body, meditation's mold!
And, O my breast, drink in the wind's reviving!
A freshness, exhalation of the sea,
Restores my soul. . . Salt-breathing potency!
Let's run at the waves and be screamed back to life!

Yes, mighty sea with such wild frenzies gifted
(The panther skin and the rent chlamys), sifted
All over with sun-images that glisten,
Creature supreme, drunk on your own blue flesh,
Who in a tumult like the deepest hush
Bite at your sequin-glittering tail -- yes, listen!

The wind is rising! . . . We must try to live!
The huge air opens and shuts my book: the wave
Dares to explode out of the rocks in reeking
Spray. Fly away, my sun-bewildered pages!
Break, waves! Break up with your rejoicing surges
This quiet roof where sails like doves were pecking.
Original French Text
The marine cemetery
Translation by C. Day Lewis


The French text and English translation side by side
This quiet roof, where doves walk,
Between the pines palpitates, between the tombs;
Noon the righteous composes fires there
The sea, the sea, always begins again
O reward after a thought
Than a long look at the calm of the gods!

What pure work of fine lightning consumes
Many a diamond of imperceptible foam,
And what peace seems to be conceived!
When on the abyss a sun rests,
Pure works of an eternal cause,
Time sparkles and the dream is knowledge.

Stable treasure, simple temple to Minerva,
Mass of calm, and visible reserve,
Careful water, Eye that keeps in you
So much sleep under a veil of flame,
O my silence! . . . Edifice in the soul,
But golden roof with a thousand tiles, Roof!

Temple of Time, which a single sigh sums up,
To this pure point I go up and get used to it,
All surrounded by my marine gaze;
And as to the gods my supreme offering,
The serene scintillation sows
On the altitude a sovereign disdain.

As the fruit melts into enjoyment,
As into delight it changes its absence
In a mouth where its form is dying,
I inhale here my future smoke,
And the sky sings to the consumed soul
The change of the banks in rumor.

Beautiful sky, real sky, look at me changing!
After so much pride, after so much strange
Idleness, but full of power,
I abandon myself to this brilliant space,
Over the houses of the dead my shadow passes
Which tames me with its frail movement.

The soul exposed to the torches of the solstice,
I support you, admirable justice
From light to merciless weapons!
I hand you pure to your first place,
Look at you! . . . But making light
Supposes to shadow a dull half.

O for me alone, for me alone, in myself,
Near a heart, at the sources of the poem,
Between the void and the pure event,
I await the echo of my internal greatness,
Bitter, dark, and sonorous cistern,
Ringing in the soul an always future hollow!

Do you know, false captive of the foliage,
Gulf devouring these meager fences,
On my closed eyes, dazzling secrets,
What body drags me to its lazy end,
What front attracts it to this bony earth?
A spark thinks of my absences.

Closed, sacred, full of a fire without matter,
Terrestrial fragment offered to the light,
This place pleases me, dominated by torches,
Composed of gold, stone and dark trees,
Where so much marble is trembling on so many 'shadows;
The faithful sea sleeps there on my tombs!

Splendid female dog, put away the idolater!
When solitary with a shepherd's smile,
I graze for a long time, mysterious sheep,
The white flock of my quiet tombs,
Keep away the prudent doves,
The vain dreams, the curious angels!

Come here, the future is laziness.
The net insect scratches the drought;
Everything is burned, undone, received in the air
with some harsh essence. . .
Life is vast,being drunk with absence,
And bitterness is sweet, and the mind is clear.

The hidden dead are indeed in this land
Which warms them and dries their mystery.
Noon up there, Noon without movement
In oneself thinks and suits oneself
Complete head and perfect diadem,
I am in you the secret change.

You only have me to contain your fears!
My repentances, my doubts, my constraints
Are the fault of your great diamond! . . .
But in their night, all heavy with marble,
A vague people at the roots of the trees
Have already slowly taken your side.

They melted into a thick absence,
The red clay drank the white species,
The gift of living passed into the flowers!
Where are the dead familiar phrases,
Personal art, singular souls?
The larva flies where the cries were formed.

The shrill cries of tickled girls,
The eyes, the teeth, the wet eyelids,
The charming breast that plays with fire,
The blood that shines on the lips that surrender,
The last gifts, the fingers that defend them,
Everything goes underground and get in the game!

And you, great soul, do you hope for a dream
Which will no longer have these colors of lie
That waves and gold create here for the eyes of flesh?
Will you sing when you are vaporous?
Come on! Everything is leaking! My presence is porous,
Holy impatience also dies!

Thin black and golden immortality,
Frightfully lauded comforter,
Who makes a maternal breast from death,
The beautiful lie and the pious ruse!
Who does not know, and who does not refuse them,
This empty skull and this eternal laughter!

Deep fathers, uninhabited heads,
Who under the weight of so many shovelfuls,
Are the earth and confuse our steps,
The true rodent, the irrefutable worm
Is not for you who sleep under the table,
It lives with life, it does not me do not leave!

Love, perhaps, or self-hatred?
His secret tooth is mine so close
That all names can suit him!
What does it matter! He sees, he wants, he dreams, he touches!
My flesh pleases him, and even on my bed,
To this living thing I live to belong!

Zeno! Cruel Zeno! Zeno of Elea!
Have you pierced me with this winged arrow
Which vibrates, flies, and which does not fly!
The sound gives birth to me and the arrow kills me!
Ah! the sun . . . What a tortoise shadow
For the soul, Achilles still with long steps!

No no! . . . Standing! In the successive era!
Break, my body, this pensive form!
Drink, my breast, the birth of the wind!
A freshness, from the exhaled sea,
Returns my soul to me. . . O salty power!
Let's run to the waves and emerge alive.

Yes! great sea of ​​gifted delirium,
Skin of a panther and holed chlamys,
Of a thousand and a thousand idols of the sun,
Absolute hydra, drunk with your blue flesh,
Which remorse your sparkling tail
In a tumult with the same silence

The wind rises! . . . we must try to live!
The immense air opens and closes my book,
The powder wave dares to spring from the rocks!
Fly away, dazzled pages!
Break up, waves! Break with rejoicing waters
This quiet roof where the jibs pecked!
