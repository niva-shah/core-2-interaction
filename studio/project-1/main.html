            <p class="quote"><a href="../project-1/page 1/quote1.html">In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it.</a></p>
            <p class="quote"><a href="../project-1/page 2/quote2.html">the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall.</a></p>
            <p class="quote"><a href="../project-1/page 3/quote3.html">Many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.</a></p>
            <p class="quote"><a href="../project-1/page 4/quote4.html">Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: <strong><span></span></strong>.</a></p>
            <p class="quote"><a href="../project-1/page 5/quote5.html">It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.</a></p>
            <p class="quote"><a href="../project-1/page 6/quote6.html">In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.</a></p>
            <p class="quote"><a href="../project-1/page 7/quote7.html">no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned</a></p>
            <p class="quote"><a href="../project-1/page 8/quote8.html">The poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind.</a></p>
