            "Poetry" by Marianne Moore

            I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond
            all this fiddle.
            Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one
            discovers in
            it after all, a place for the genuine.
            Hands that can grasp, eyes
            that can dilate, hair that can rise
            if it must, these things are important not because a
            
            high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because
            they are
            useful. When they become so derivative as to become
            unintelligible,
            the same thing may be said for all of us, that we
            do not admire what
            we cannot understand: the bat
            holding on upside down or in quest of something to
            
            eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless
            wolf under
            a tree, the immovable critic twitching his skin like a horse
            that feels a flea, the baseball fan, the statistician—
            nor is it valid
            to discriminate against "business documents and
            
            school-books"; all these phenomena are important. One must make
            a distinction
            however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the
            result is not poetry,
            nor till the poets among us can be
            "literalists of
            the imagination"—above
            insolence and triviality and can present
            
            for inspection, "imaginary gardens with real toads in them,"
            shall we have
            it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand,
            the raw material of poetry in
            all its rawness and
            that which is on the other hand
            genuine, you are interested in poetry.

            "Ars Poetica" by Archibald MacLeish 
            
            A poem should be palpable and mute   
            As a globed fruit,
            
            Dumb
            As old medallions to the thumb,
            
            Silent as the sleeve-worn stone
            Of casement ledges where the moss has grown—
            
            A poem should be wordless   
            As the flight of birds.
            
            
            A poem should be motionless in time   
            As the moon climbs,
            
            Leaving, as the moon releases
            Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,
            
            Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,   
            Memory by memory the mind—
            
            A poem should be motionless in time   
            As the moon climbs.
            
            
            A poem should be equal to:
            Not true.
            
            For all the history of grief
            An empty doorway and a maple leaf.
            
            For love
            The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea—
            
            A poem should not mean   
            But be.
            
            <strong> 
            MacLeish argues poems should have a tangible yet elusive mystery.</strong>

            "Introduction to Poetry" by Billy Collins 
            
            I ask them to take a poem
            and hold it up to the light
            like a color slide
            
            or press an ear against its hive.
            
            I say drop a mouse into a poem
            and watch him probe his way out,
            
            or walk inside the poem’s room
            and feel the walls for a light switch.
            
            I want them to waterski
            across the surface of a poem
            waving at the author’s name on the shore.
            
            But all they want to do
            is tie the poem to a chair with rope
            and torture a confession out of it.
            
            They begin beating it with a hose
            to find out what it really means.
            
            <strong> 
            Collins satirizes simplistic explanation of a poem's meaning, 
            arguing it should be pondered more obliquely.</strong></pre>
